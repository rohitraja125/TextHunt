# TextHunt

TextHunt is a web application designed to efficiently search through and rank documents based on a user's query. The application processes multiple document formats, including `.jpeg`, `.jpg`, `.png`, `.pdf`, and `.docx`, and highlights the query terms within the documents, making it easier to find the most relevant content.
